## Description
This repository contains a MATLAB codebase for the study of the idealized dynamics of collective learning and their corresponding impact on robot energy consumption.

## Paper and citation
TBD


## Installation
Everything works on MATLAB R2023b. All the files required are already contained in the repository.


## Usage
The class `RobotCollective.m` is used to instantiate a robot collective. To see the results corresponding to each of the sudies discussed on the paper run:
- `scrpt_run_collective_learning_regimes.m` Computes the nine collective learning regimes (ideal cases with no repetitions in the learned skills per batch)
- `scrpt_run_collective_learning_smart_factory.m` Assumes repeated skills per batch. It may take significant time to run this scenario.
