\section{Energy grand challenges in embodied AI: perspective and research directions}\label{sec:energy_grand_challenges}
%Based on the energy expenditure categories introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:intro}, we have identified three grand energy demand challenges in embodied AI. We discuss them individually in the following, highlighting their implications on future energy consumption.
In this section we discuss three grand energy demand challenges related to the expenditure categories of embodied AI systems, introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:intro}, and highlight their implications on their future of energy consumption.

\subsection{\textbf{CHALLENGE 1} (C1). Energy for AI infrastructure}
Most state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms depend on significant volumes of data and a vast number of computing iterations to converge to a solution \cite{Strubell2019EnergyAP}. To accelerate the time spent training such models, researchers and companies take advantage of the readily available infrastructure or use several cloud computing services running on data centers. Serving many purposes, data centers have turned into a relevant energy sink. For instance, in the years from 2015 to 2021, the worldwide energy use of data centers moved from 200 TWh to an estimated 220-320 TWh\footnote{Data from the International Energy Agency, see \url{https://www.iea.org/reports/data-centres-and-data-transmission-networks}}. Comparatively, only in Germany, the energy consumption of data centers increased from 10 TWh in 2010 to 17 TWh in 2021. At this rate, experts anticipate that data centers in the country will require 28 TWh by 2030 \cite{Hintemann2022Cloudcomputingdrives}. Fig.~\ref{fig:dataCenterEnergy} illustrates the increasing trend in the energy demand from data centers.

To exacerbate the problem, unlike reference state-of-the-art machine learning models (e.g., transformer models) that are trained once on a large amount of data (considering also eventual retraining every certain period of time), EAI systems will use models that require constant retraining and re-evaluation, such as neural architecture search \cite{real2019regularized}. Another key contributor to the energy consumption of EAI systems emerged due to recent techniques that allowed data sample complexity to increase from precisely located sensor measurements to full camera images, scaling up the number of computations required in a given architecture iteration \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}. In summary, the grand challenge is, in our view, the development of efficient learning algorithms that take into account the need for constant re-learning and make efficient use of the rich multimodal sensor data that has been and is collected by the EAI agents to alleviate the computational load and ultimately reduceÂ´ the energy consumption associated to it. %capable of reducing the average energy demand despite the increase in processing complexity of the sensory data.

\subsection{\textbf{CHALLENGE 2} (C2). Energy for the masses}\label{sec:robots_challenge}
As mentioned earlier in Sec.~\ref{sec:energy_in_robotics}, the number of robots in service keeps increasing. The advent of Industry 4.0 and the smart factory accentuates this trend, as does the increasing use of robots in service applications. Despite better robots with improved energy efficiency, the focus is mostly on individual systems, with the aggregate effect of all the active units usually escaping attention. Said succinctly, \emph{more robots, more energy demand}.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Industrial robots}
In the last decade, the install base of industrial robots has gone from 1.2 million units in 2012 to around 3.5 million units in 2022, signifying a 290 \% increase. According to the International Federation of Robotics, the yearly growth has been between 12-15 \% since 2012 \cite{IFR2019}. Based on this rate, an astonishing four million robots are estimated to operate in factories worldwide in a few years. Fig.~\ref{fig:ir_stock} projects this trend until 2025, showing that the install base of industrial robots will be almost three times larger than 2015\footnote{These numbers are in the neighborhood of a slightly more conservative prediction for the robot operational stock presented by \textit{The Boston Consulting Group} in \cite{sirkin2015}.}. Using this projection, and assuming 24/7 operation, we estimate the expected energy demand of industrial robots, i.e., the total \textit{World Robot Energy Consumption} (WREC)\footnote{To determine an estimate of the electric energy consumption derived from the worldwide operational stock of industrial robots, the market distribution per manufacturer was considered as well as an estimate of the average power consumption according to the robot's category (e.g., assembling, processing, welding, etc.). Further details can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:app_robot_ener_consumption}.}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:ir_energy}. For reference, the WREC in 2025 represents 7.2 \% of the installed electricity generation capacity in Germany (one of the leading industrialized nations) \cite{fraunhofer2016}. 

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Collaborative robots and service robots}
Just like industrial robots, the future impact of collaborative and service robots must not be disregarded. As an example, collaborative robots (cobots) jumped from representing only 6 \% of the market in 2017 to about one-quarter of the yearly installations in the present, see Fig. \ref{fig:industrial_cobot_share} \cite{tobe2015}. Using similar assumptions as for industrial robots (see Appendix~\ref{sec:app_cobot_ener_consumption}), Fig.~\ref{fig:cobot_stock} and \ref{fig:cobot_energy} show the expected growth and corresponding energy consumption for this class of robots. Just as cobots, service robots are \textit{booming}. The IFR estimated, for example, that the sales of privately used service robots increased to around 35 million units in 2018 \cite{IFR2015}. Applied to various fields including, but not limited to, logistics, defense, public relations, medical applications, etc. The numbers of service robots exhibit the mirror the rapidly increasing trend of industrial and collaborative robots.

\subsubsection{Implications}
Modern production paradigms, lifestyle, and societal needs will make robots ubiquitous, permeating many aspects of human life. Consequently, just by their sheer number, industrial, collaborative, and service robots already represent a currently disregarded niche in the global energy landscape. The quantities introduced in this section serve as a rough estimate of the BEE and MI energetic requirements of AI systems during standard operation. The challenge here consists in devising better strategies for efficiently using these legions of robots. Concretely, if the skills these robots learn and execute are performed in the most time- and energy-optimal fashion, then BEE and MI energies will consequently be kept at the optimal minimum.

\subsection{\textbf{CHALLENGE 3} (C3). Energy for manufacturing}
This last challenge expands the scope and considers the energetic cost of manufacturing the EAI agents. Although not the focus of this work, we briefly discuss it for completeness and to motivate its study in future works. C3 involves, firstly, the energy to procure the materials needed for the manufacturing of robots and its associated computation hardware. Secondly, the energy demanded by the manufacturing process itself. As the energy required for material procurement and the manufacturing process is directly proportional to the number of EAI agents manufactured, it follows that if their numbers increase exponentially, so will the energy consumed to produce them. Analyzing this demand and devising strategies to handle it are central to this challenge. Although no clear solution is apparent, and since meaningful energy savings in the procurement of raw materials are unrealistic, we see significant potential for energy savings in robot recycling strategies. As a final thought, it is likely that in the future, EAI agents will manufacture other EAI agents (e.g., see Fig.~\ref{fig:franka_builds_franka}), connecting this challenge directly with challenges C1 and C2.

\subsection{Potential research directions}
To identify areas of opportunity given the previously discussed challenges, we first need to consider a crucial fact: for any given task, there is a physical limit to the energy that can be saved. To understand this, consider the following: let $\tau$ be a desired skill for an EAI agent; e.g., pick-and-place. Additionally, assume that the optimal trajectory $p$ to move the object from origin to destination is known. Then, the properties of the to-be-moved object and the path $p$ fully determine the minimum energy $E^*_{\tau}$ required to execute skill $\tau$. This means an embodied AI agent attempting to execute $\tau$ will consume at least this much energy. In reality, however, the total energy required for learning and performing a skill comprises the sum of $E^*_{\tau}$ plus the accompanying computational $E_{CCE}$, body-related $E_{BEE}$ and motion and interaction $E_{MIE}$ energy requirements during learning and execution; i.e.
% ---
\begin{equation}
	E_{\tau} =  \underbrace{E^*_{\tau}}_{\text{Skill energy}} + E_{BEE} + \underbrace{E_{CCE} + E_{MIE}}_{\text{Learning energy}}.
\end{equation}
% ---
Fig.~\ref{fig:challengesConnected} depicts the connections between the grand challenges and their associated energy expenditure categories. Related to \textbf{challenge 1} and $E_{CCE}$, one direction that the embodied AI research community should focus on is developing energy-aware algorithms either by concentrating on more data-efficient approaches, embedding relevant prior knowledge in the models or incorporating knowledge sharing capabilities. In particular, the latter would be an ideal candidate solution due to its raw potential. An algorithm capable of sharing and transferring knowledge would allow for high efficiency in multi-skill learning and, associated with a cloud-connected library of skills, would accelerate learning new skills on every EAI agent connected to it. This approach would, over time, convert the processing requirement of the data centers into mostly database storage and query, which is much less energy-demanding.

Additionally, better computational algorithms could be defined, running in more efficient hardware and supported by more efficient communication mechanisms. As for \textbf{challenge 2}, most of the problem links to the rapid growth in the numbers of active robots that will power the future, but their potential energy-inefficient design and wasted capabilities should not be disregarded. As such, C2 is related to $E_{BEE}$ and $E_{MIE}$. Since there is no control over the eventual number of robots, new designs with lightweight materials and elastic elements that foster the efficient use of the available energy to perform a skill should be pursued. In turn, these new mechatronic designs should be exploited by the EAI algorithms researched in \textbf{challenge 1} to find better solutions to learn and execute skills. Finally, \textbf{challenge 3}, is highly intertwined with the first two challenges and, thus, is linked to three types of energy $E_{CCE}$, $E_{BEE}$ and $E_{MIE}$. Consequently, approaches to tackling challenges C1 and C2 will yield improvements to C3. Finally, a parallel and complementary direction to save energy in manufacturing is recycling. A competent recycling process should integrate with manufacturing, where parts can be salvaged from decommissioned robots and the rest can be harvested for materials.
