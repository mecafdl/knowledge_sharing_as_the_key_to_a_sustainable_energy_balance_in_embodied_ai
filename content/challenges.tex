\section{Energy grand challenges in embodied AI: perspective and research directions}\label{sec:energy_grand_challenges}
Based on the energy expenditure categories introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:intro}, we have identified three grand energy demand challenges in embodied AI. We discuss them individually in the following, highlighting their implications on future energy consumption.

% SUBSECTION ========================================================================================
\subsection{\textbf{CHALLENGE 1} (C1). Energy for AI infrastructure}
%This challenge is directly connected to the computation and indirectly related to the motion/interaction energy demands depicted in Fig.~\ref{fig:embodied_ai_pipeline}.
Most state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms depend on significant volumes of data or a vast number of computational iterations to converge to a solution \cite{Strubell2019EnergyAP}. To accelerate the time spent training such models, researchers and companies take advantage of the readily available infrastructure or use several cloud computing services running on data centers. A new analysis estimates that data center workloads have increased more than sixfold since 2010. That year, they consumed roughly 194 terawatt-hours (TWh) of energy or 1 \% of worldwide electricity use. Data-center energy use grew just 6 percent to 205 TWh. Fig. \ref{fig:dataCenterEnergy} illustrates the increasing trend in the energy demand from data centers.

As shown in \cite{Strubell2019EnergyAP}, reference state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms require an incredible amount of computations, especially those requiring constant retraining and re-evaluation, such as neural architecture search \cite{real2019regularized}. A key contribution to increasing the energy consumption of machine learning algorithms emerged because recent techniques allowed data sample complexity to increase from precisely located sensor measurements to full camera images, scaling up the number of computations required in a given architecture iteration \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet}. The challenge now is to research algorithms capable of reducing the average energy demand despite the increase in processing complexity of the sensory data.

% SUBSECTION ========================================================================================
\subsection{\textbf{CHALLENGE 2} (C2). Energy for the masses}\label{sec:robots_challenge}
As mentioned earlier in Sec.~\ref{sec:energy_in_robotics}, the numbers of robots in service keep increasing. The advent of Industry 4.0 and the smart factory will accentuate this trend, as does the increasing use of robots in service applications. In spite of better robotic systems with improved energy efficiency, analysis tends to focus on individual systems with the aggregate effect of all the active units usually escaping attention. Said succinctly, \emph{more robots, more energy demand}. %In this section we elaborate on this claim and discuss its implications on the global energy landscape.

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Industrial robots}
In the last years, the install base of industrial robots has gone from 1,235,389 units in 2012 to an estimate of 3,152,000 units in 2020; signifying a 250 \% increase in only eight years. According to the International Federation of Robotics, the yearly growth has been between 12-15 \% since 2012 \cite{IFR2019}. Based on this rate an astonishing four million robots are estimated to be currently operating in factories around the world. Fig.~\ref{fig:ir_stock} projects this trend until 2025, showing that the install base of industrial robots will be almost three times larger than 2015\footnote{These numbers are in the neighborhood of a slightly more conservative prediction for the robot operational stock presented by \textit{The Boston Consulting Group} in \cite{sirkin2015}.}. Using this projection, and assuming 24/7 operation, we estimate the expected energy demand of industrial robots, i.e., the total \textit{World Robot Energy Consumption} (WREC)\footnote{To determine an estimate of the electric energy consumption derived from the worldwide operational stock of industrial robots, the market distribution per manufacturer was considered as well as an estimate of the average power consumption according to the robot's category (e.g. assembling, processing, welding, etc.). Further details can be found in Appendix~\ref{sec:app_robot_ener_consumption}.}, see Fig.~\ref{fig:ir_energy}. For reference, the WREC in 2025 represents 7.2 \% of the installed electricity generation capacity in Germany (one of the leading industrialized nations) \cite{fraunhofer2016}. 

% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\subsubsection{Collaborative robots and service robots}
Just as industrial robots, the future impact of collaborative and service robots must not be disregarded. As an example, collaborative robots (cobots) jumped from representing only 6 \% of the market in 2017 to about one quarter of the installed base today, see Fig. \ref{fig:industrial_cobot_share} \cite{tobe2015}. Using similar assumptions as for industrial robots, Fig.~\ref{fig:cobot_stock} and \ref{fig:cobot_energy} show the expected growth and corresponding energy consumption for this class of robots. Similar to cobots, service robots are \textit{booming}. The IFR estimated, for example, that the sales of privately used service robots increased to around 35 million units in 2018 \cite{IFR2015}. Applied to a diverse variety of fields including, but not limited to, logistics, defense, public relations, medical applications, etc.; the numbers of service robots exhibit the same increasing trend as industrial and collaborative robots.

\subsubsection{Implications}
Modern production paradigms and lifestyle and societal needs will make robots ubiquitous, permeating many aspects of human life. As a consequence, just by their sheer number, industrial, collaborative, and service robots already represent a currently disregarded niche in the global energy landscape. In standard operation, the energy they consume corresponds naturally to the BEE and MI categories in embodied AI systems and thus, the numbers introduced in this section serve as an indication of the base energetic requirements in embodied AI. Concretely, the challenge here consists on devising better strategies for the efficient use of these legions of robots. That is, if the skills that these robots take care of are performed in the most time and energy optimal fashion then BEE and MI energies will also be kept at the optimal minimum.

\subsection{\textbf{CHALLENGE 3} (C3). Energy for manufacturing}
Although not the focus of this work we briefly discuss this challenge for completeness and to motivate its study in future works. This last challenge expands the scope and considers the energetic cost pertaining to the manufacturing process of the EAI agents. It involves, firstly, the energy to procure the materials needed for the manufacturing of robots and the computation infrastructure. Secondly, the energy demanded by the manufacturing process itself. As the energy needed for material procurement and the manufacturing process is directly linked to the number of EAI agents being manufactured, it can be logically concluded that if their numbers increase exponentially, so will the energy consumed to produce them. Analysing this demand and devising strategies to handle it are at the center of this challenge. Although no clear solution is apparent, and since  meaningful energy savings in the procurement of the raw materials does not seem to be realistic possibility, we see in robot recycling a large potential strategy for energy savings. As a final thought, it is likely that in the future, the manufacturing of EAI agents will be conducted by other EAI agents (e.g. see Fig.~\ref{fig:franka_builds_franka}); thus connecting this challenge directly with the first two challenges.

%\textcolor{red}{The first two challenges addressed energy demand derived from the main composing elements of embodied AI. This last challenge deals with a broader perspective and considers the manufacturing of the hardware itself. Although not the focus of this work we briefly discuss this challenge for completeness and to motivate its study in future works. The production of EAI agents involves, firstly, energy to procure the materials (e.g. metal and plastic) needed for the manufacturing of robots and the computation infrastructure. Secondly, the energy necessary for the manufacturing process itself needs to be accounted for. Roughly, as the energy needed for material procurement an manufacturing process is directly linked to the number of robots being manufactured, and considering the exponentially increasing number of robots in service, a logical extrapolation is that this energy will also increase substantially. Analysing this demand and devising strategies to handle it are at the center of this challenge. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is a lack of studies that formally address the amount of energy needed to manufacture a robot. To provide a rough estimate of this demand, we leverage numbers from other well researched related areas and transfer them to the robot manufacturing context. In particular, we use records from the car manufacturing industry \cite{sullivan2010energy} and assume the \emph{technological density} of a robot and a car to be similar. As a result, we estimate that energy-wise, the demand to manufacture one ton of robots in analogous to manufacturing one ton one ton of cars. An average car with $\unit[1.5]{t}$ needs up to $\unit[34]{MJ}$ and up to $\unit[70]{t}$ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{[REF]}} of raw material. For example, \textcolor{red}{via direct scaling} one single KUKA 240 weighing $\unit[2]{t}$ \textcolor{red}{\textbf{[REF]}} is estimated to roughly need up to $\unit[45]{MJ}$ of energy and $\unit[90]{t}$ of raw materials. Simply multiplying this result by the numbers shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:ir_stock} gives already an idea of the magnitude of this challenge.  Although no clear solution is apparent, and since  meaningful energy savings in the procurement of the raw materials does not seem to be realistic possibility, we ponder that large potential energy savings would come from robot recycling. Nonetheless, this discussion is left for a latter occasion. As a final thought, it is likely that in the future, the manufacturing of embodied AI systems will be conducted by other embodied AI systems (eg. see Fig.~\ref{fig:franka_builds_franka}); thus connecting this with the first two challenges.}

\subsection{Potential research directions}
To identify areas of opportunity given the previously discussed challenges we first need to consider a crucial fact: for any given task, there is a physical limit to the energy that can be saved. To understand this consider the following, let $\tau$ be a desired skill for an EAI agent; for instance, pick-and-place. Additionally, assume that the optimal trajectory $p$ to move the object from origin to destination is known. Then, the properties of the to-be-moved object and the path $p$ fully determine the minimum energy $E^*_{\tau}$ required to execute skill $\tau$. This means that an embodied AI agent attempting to execute $\tau$ will consume at least this amount of energy. In reality, however, the total energy required for learning and executing a skill comprises the sum of $E^*_{\tau}$ plus the accompanying computational $E_{CCE}$, body-related $E_{BEE}$ and motion and interaction $E_{MIE}$ energy requirements during learning and execution; i.e.
% ---
\begin{equation}
     E_{\tau} =  E^*_{\tau} +  E_{CCE} +  E_{BEE} +  E_{MIE}.
\end{equation}
% ---
Fig.~\ref{fig:challengesConnected} depicts the potential connections that exist between the grand challenges and the energy expenditure categories that are relevant for each of them. Related to \textbf{challenge 1} and $E_{CCE}$, one direction that the embodied AI research community should focus is on developing energy-aware algorithms. Either by focusing on more data-efficient approaches, embedding relevant prior knowledge in the architecture, or knowledge sharing capabilities. The last, in particular, would be an ideal candidate solution due to its raw potential. An algorithm capable of sharing knowledge would allow for high efficiency in multi-skill learning and, associated with a cloud-connected library of skills, accelerate new skill learning on every EAI agent connected to it. This approach would, over time, convert the processing requirement of the data centers into mostly database storage and query, which is much less energy demanding. Additionally, better computational algorithms could be defined aided running in more efficient processing and supported by more efficient communication mechanisms. As for \textbf{challenge 2}, most of the problem is attributed to the rapid growth in the numbers of active robots that will power future manufacturing industry but their potentially energy inefficient design and/or wasted capabilities should not be disregarded; thus it is related to $E_{BEE}$ and $E_{MIE}$. Since there is no actual control over the eventual number of robots, new designs with light weight materials and elastic elements that foster the efficient use of the available energy to perform a skill should be pursued. These new mechatronic designs should, in turn, be exploited by embodied AI algorithms researched in \textbf{challenge 1} to find yet better solutions to learn and execute skills. Finally, \textbf{challenge 3}, is highly intertwined with other two challenges and, thus, is linked to three types of energy $E_{CCE}$, $E_{BEE}$ and $E_{MIE}$. This means that improvements in the challenge 1 and 2 will yield improvements in challenge 3. Yet, a vital direction to save energy in manufacturing is recycling. A competent recycling process is coupled with the manufacturing where robots that end their service life can be harvested for materials and parts, a zero waste policy could be implemented.
