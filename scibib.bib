    abstract = { This work presents the concept of tele-impedance as a method for remotely controlling a robotic arm in interaction with uncertain environments. As an alternative to bilateral force-reflecting teleoperation control, in tele-impedance a compound reference command is sent to the slave robot including both the desired motion trajectory and impedance profile, which are then realized by the remote controller without explicit feedback to the operator. We derive the reference command from a novel body–machine interface (BMI) applied to the master operator’s arm, using only non-intrusive position and electromyography (EMG) measurements, and excluding any feedback from the remote site except for looking at the task. The proposed BMI exploits a novel algorithm to decouple the estimates of force and stiffness of the human arm while performing the task. The endpoint (wrist) position of the human arm is monitored by an optical tracking system and used for the closed-loop position control of the robot’s end-effector. The concept is demonstrated in two experiments, namely a peg-in-the-hole and a ball-catching task, which illustrate complementary aspects of the method. The performance of tele-impedance control is assessed by comparing the results obtained with the slave arm under either constantly low or high stiffness. }

In this paper, we take a novel and general view of task decoupling in which we identify link subsystems primarily responsible for completion of a subset of the manipulator task components, which is not necessarily position or orientation. Our analysis leads to the discovery of other decoupled manipulator geometries never identified before, wherein the decoupled system is responsible for a subset of degress-of-freedom involving a hybrid combination of both position and orientation. Closed-form inverse kinematic solutions for these manipulator geometries are therefore guaranteed. Task decoupling also implied singularity decoupling wherein singularities of decoupled subsystems are equivalent to the manipulator singularities. The analysis leads to a novel and efficient method for identifying the singularities and solving the inverse kinematics problem of six-axes manipulators with decoupled geometries. The practicality of the concepts introduced is demonstrated through an industrial robot example involving a hybrid position and orientation decoupling.},

Here we demonstrate that subjective estimates of uncertainty predict the dynamics of subjective and physiological stress responses. Subjects learned a probabilistic mapping between visual stimuli and electric shocks. Salivary cortisol confirmed that our stressor elicited changes in endocrine activity. Using a hierarchical Bayesian learning model, we quantified the relationship between the different forms of subjective task uncertainty and acute stress responses. Subjective stress, pupil diameter and skin conductance all tracked the evolution of irreducible uncertainty. We observed a coupling between emotional and somatic state, with subjective and physiological tuning to uncertainty tightly correlated. Furthermore, the uncertainty tuning of subjective and physiological stress predicted individual task performance, consistent with an adaptive role for stress in learning under uncertain threat. Our finding that stress responses are tuned to environmental uncertainty provides new insight into their generation and likely adaptive function.},

However, most attention is given to discrete tasks with simple action spaces, such as board games and classic video games. Less discussed in neuroscience are parallel advances in “synthetic motor control”. While motor neuroscience has recently focused on optimization of single, simple movements, AI has progressed to the generation of rich, diverse motor behaviors across multiple tasks, at humanoid scale. It is becoming clear that specific, well-motivated hierarchical design elements repeatedly arise when engineering these flexible control systems. We review these core principles of hierarchical control, relate them to hierarchy in the nervous system, and highlight research themes that we anticipate will be critical in solving challenges at this disciplinary intersection.},

The interruptive function of pain depends on the relationship between pain-related characteristics (e.g., the threat value of pain) and the characteristics of the environmental demands (e.g., emotional arousal). A model of the interruptive function of pain is developed that holds that pain is selected for action from within complex affective and motivational environments to urge escape. The implications of this model for research and therapy are outlined with an emphasis on the redefinition of chronic pain as chronic interruption.},

  abstract           = {This study set out to evaluate nociceptive withdrawal reflex (NWR) excitability and the corresponding mechanical response in the upper limbs during rest and movement. We used a three-dimensional motion analysis system and a surface EMG system to record, in 10 healthy subjects, the NWR in eight upper limb muscles and the corresponding mechanical response in two experimental conditions: rest and movement (reaching for, picking up, and moving a cylinder). The NWR was elicited through stimulation of the index finger with trains of pulses delivered at multiples of the pain threshold (PT). We correlated movement types (reach-to-grasp, grasp-and-lift), movement phases (acceleration, deceleration), and muscle activity types (shortening, lengthening, isometric) with the presence/absence of the NWR (reflex-muscle pattern), with NWR size values, and with the mechanical responses. At rest, when the stimulus was delivered at 4x PT, the NWR was present, in all muscles, in >90% of trials, and the mechanical response consisted of wrist adduction, elbow flexion, and shoulder anteflexion. At this stimulus intensity, during movement, the reflex-muscle pattern, reflex size, and mechanical responses were closely modulated by movement type and phase and by muscle activity type. We did not find, during movement, significant correlations with the level of EMG background activity. Our findings suggest that a complex functional adaptation of the spinal cord plays a role in modulating the NWR in the transition from rest to movement and during voluntary arm movement freely performed in three-dimensional space. Study of the upper limb NWR may provide a window onto the spinal neural control mechanisms operating during movement.},

Novel tongue-task training consisted of tracking a moving target box by generating a pre-set amount of tongue-protrusion force onto a force lever. Analysis of motor behaviour revealed (i) a higher within-session gain for the 30-min tongue-task training regime, but this difference did not differentially affect the time course of the overall motor performance or additional motor performance variables between the 15- and 30-min tongue-task training regimes in subsequent training sessions. (ii) somatosensory manipulations of the tongue tip reduced the gains in overall motor performance, and this reduced motor performance was mainly characterized by exaggerated undershoot errors and delayed reaction times for the lidocaine tongue-task training regime and exaggerated overshoot and undershoot errors as well as delayed reaction times for the capsaicin tongue-task training regime. It is concluded that extended within-session task repetitions do not facilitate additional long-term gains in overall motor performance and intra-oral sensory loss or pain hinders motor learning.},

  abstract               = {Money is a secondary reinforcer commonly used across a range of disciplines in experimental paradigms investigating reward learning and decision-making. The effectiveness of monetary reinforcers during aversive learning and associated neural basis, however, remains a topic of debate. Specifically, it is unclear if the initial acquisition of aversive representations of monetary losses depends on similar neural systems as more traditional aversive conditioning that involves primary reinforcers. This study contrasts the efficacy of a biologically defined primary reinforcer (shock) and a socially defined secondary reinforcer (money) during aversive learning and its associated neural circuitry. During a two-part experiment, participants first played a gambling game where wins and losses were based on performance to gain an experimental bank. Participants were then exposed to two separate aversive conditioning sessions. In one session, a primary reinforcer (mild shock) served as an unconditioned stimulus (US) and was paired with one of two colored squares, the conditioned stimuli (CS+ and CS-, respectively). In another session, a secondary reinforcer (loss of money) served as the US and was paired with one of two different CS. Skin conductance responses were greater for CS+ compared to CS- trials irrespective of type of reinforcer. Neuroimaging results revealed that the striatum, a region typically linked with reward-related processing, was found to be involved in the acquisition of aversive conditioned response irrespective of reinforcer type. In contrast, the amygdala was involved during aversive conditioning with primary reinforcers, as suggested by both an exploratory fMRI analysis and a follow-up case study with a patient with bilateral amygdala damage. Taken together, these results suggest that learning about potential monetary losses may depend on reinforcement learning related systems, rather than on typical structures involved in more biologically based fears.},

Previous neuroimaging studies showed distraction-related modulations of pain-driven activations in various cortical and subcortical brain regions, but the precise neuronal mechanism underlying this phenomenon is unclear. Using high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging of the human cervical spinal cord in combination with thermal pain stimulation and a well-established working memory task, we demonstrate that this phenomenon relies on an inhibition of incoming pain signals in the spinal cord. Neuronal responses to painful stimulation in the dorsal horn of the corresponding spinal segment were significantly reduced under high working memory load compared to low working memory load. At the individual level, reductions of neuronal responses in the spinal cord predicted behavioral pain reductions. In a subsequent behavioral experiment, using the opioid antagonist naloxone in a double-blind crossover design with the same paradigm, we demonstrate a substantial contribution of endogenous opioids to this mechanism. Taken together, our results show that the reduced pain experience during mental distraction is related to a spinal process and involves opioid neurotransmission.},

  abstract               = {Most patients receiving intensive rehabilitation to improve their upper limb function experience pain. Despite this, the impact of pain on the ability to learn a specific motor task is still unknown. The aim of this study was to determine whether the presence of experimental tonic pain interferes with the acquisition and retention stages of motor learning associated with training in a reaching task. Twenty-nine healthy subjects were randomized to either a Control or Pain Group (receiving topical capsaicin cream on the upper arm during training on Day 1). On two consecutive days, subjects made ballistic movements towards two targets (NEAR/FAR) using a robotized exoskeleton. On Day 1, the task was performed without (baseline) and with a force field (adaptation). The adaptation task was repeated on Day 2. Task performance was assessed using index distance from the target at the end of the reaching movement. Motor planning was assessed using initial angle of deviation of index trajectory from a straight line to the target. Results show that tonic pain did not affect baseline reaching. Both groups improved task performance across time (p<0.001), but the Pain group showed a larger final error (under-compensation) than the Control group for the FAR target (p = 0.030) during both acquisition and retention. Moreover, a Group x Time interaction (p = 0.028) was observed on initial angle of deviation, suggesting that subjects with Pain made larger adjustments in the feedforward component of the movement over time. Interestingly, behaviour of the Pain group was very stable from the end of Day 1 (with pain) to the beginning of Day 2 (pain-free), indicating that the differences observed could not solely be explained by the impact of pain on immediate performance. This suggests that if people learn to move differently in the presence of pain, they might maintain this altered strategy over time.},

  abstract           = {Many patients are in pain when they receive gait training during rehabilitation. Based on animal studies, it has been proposed that central sensitization associated to nociception (maladaptive plasticity) and plasticity related to the sensorimotor learning (adaptive plasticity) share similar neural mechanisms and compete with each other. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether experimental tonic pain influences motor learning (acquisition and next-day retention) of a new locomotor task. Thirty healthy human subjects performed a locomotor adaptation task (perturbing force field applied to the ankle during swing using a robotized orthosis) on 2 consecutive days. Learning was assessed using kinematic measures (peak and mean absolute plantarflexion errors) and electromyographic (EMG) activity. Half of the participants performed the locomotor adaptation task with pain on Day 1 (capsaicin cream around the ankle), while the task was performed pain-free for all subjects on Day 2 to assess retention. Pain had no significant effect on baseline gait parameters nor on performance during the locomotor adaptation task (for either kinematic or EMG measures) on Day 1. Despite this apparently normal motor acquisition, pain-free Day 2 performance was markedly and significantly impaired in the Pain group, indicating that pain during training had an impact on the retention of motor memories (interfering with consolidation and/or retrieval). These results suggest that the same motor rehabilitation intervention could be less effective if administered in the presence of pain.},

Understanding the mechanisms of pain can give insight into the implementation of artificial pain for robots. Identification of noxious contacts could help robots to elicit reactions in order to avoid or minimize damage to the robot and the environment. The information processing of artificial pain can also be used to optimally regulate incoming sensory information and prevent accidents or real pain to the users of robotic systems and prostheses, improving the performance of robots and their interaction with human users. Besides the applications of artificial nociception for robotic manipulation and intelligent prostheses, the development of computational models of pain mechanisms for the discrimination of noxious stimuli from innocuous touch can find crucial clinical applications, addressing the vulnerable non-verbal population who are unable to report pain.},

  abstract           = {Studies show that inducing a positive mood or diverting attention from pain decreases pain perception. Nevertheless, induction manipulations, such as viewing interesting movies or performing mathematical tasks, often influence both emotional and attentional states. Imaging studies have examined the neural basis of psychological pain modulation, but none has explicitly separated the effects of emotion and attention. Using odors to modulate mood and shift attention from pain, we previously showed that the perceptual consequences of changing mood differed from those of altering attention, with mood primarily altering pain unpleasantness and attention preferentially altering pain intensity. These findings suggest that brain circuits involved in pain modulation provoked by mood or attention are partially separable. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to directly compare the neurocircuitry involved in mood- and attention-related pain modulation. We manipulated independently mood state and attention direction, using tasks involving heat pain and pleasant and unpleasant odors. Pleasant odors, independent of attentional focus, induced positive mood changes and decreased pain unpleasantness and pain-related activity within the anterior cingulate (ACC), medial thalamus, and primary and secondary somatosensory cortices. The effects of attentional state were less robust, with only the activity in anterior insular cortex (aIC) showing possible attentional modulation. Lateral inferior frontal cortex [LinfF; Brodmann's area (BA) 45/47] activity correlated with mood-related modulation, whereas superior posterior parietal (SPP; BA7) and entorhinal activity correlated with attention-related modulation. ACC activity covaried with LinfF and periacqueductal gray activity, whereas aIC activity covaried with SPP activity. These findings suggest that separate neuromodulatory circuits underlie emotional and attentional modulation of pain.},

Timing of ball release appears crucial as previous studies report required timing accuracies as short as 1-2ms, which however appear physiologically challenging. This study mathematically and experimentally demonstrates that humans can overcome these seemingly stringent timing requirements by shaping their hand trajectories to create extended timing windows, where ball releases achieve target hits despite temporal imprecision. Subjects practiced four task variations in a virtual environment, each with a distinct geometry of the solution space and different demands for timing. Model-based analyses of arm trajectories revealed that subjects first decreased timing error, followed by lengthening timing windows in their hand trajectories. This pattern was invariant across solution spaces, except for a control case. Hence, the exquisite skill that humans evolved for throwing is achieved by developing strategies that are less sensitive to temporal variability arising from neuromotor noise. This analysis also provides an explanation why coaches emphasize the "follow-through" in many ball sports.},

A central goal of this work is to minimize unnecessary interaction forces on the residual limb by compensating gravity effects via a upper body grounded exoskeleton. Furthermore, the exoskeleton provides the residual limb's kinematic data that allows to design more intelligent coordinated control concepts. The soft-robotics design of a prototype consisting of a transhumeral prosthesis and a robot-based exoskeleton substitute is outlined. For this class of hybrid systems a human embodied dynamics model and semi-autonomous coordinated motion strategies are derived. Here, in contrast to established standard sequential strategies all joints are moved simultaneously according to a desired task. In combination with an app-based programming framework the strategy goals are set either user-based via kinesthetic teaching or autonomously via 3D visual perception. This enables the user to execute tasks faster and more intuitive. First experimental evaluations show promising performance with a healthy subject.},

To further extend this line of research, a thorough understanding of the synergy spaces in which human movements are planed and executed is necessary. In this paper, the shoulder-arm kinematic and muscular synergies for typical 30 daily-life tasks are identified. For this, an experimental dataset of multi-joint motion trajectories and surface electromyograms of 6 healthy male subjects was created. Based on this, the synergies are identified by applying state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The identification results suggest 1) synergy space dimensionality correlates with task complexity, 2) 3-D synergy spaces are sufficient to explain ≳95% variance, 3) presumably, each task is mainly executed in its own kinematic and muscular synergy space, and 4) the similarity in synergy coordinates is indicated to correlate to similarity in joint space. Subsequently, these synergy spaces shall be integrated into human-inspired controller design of robotic systems for improved rehabilitation, assistance, and more human-like prosthetic devices.},

However, human motor optimization studies have focused on tasks that are always satisfied by increasing impedance and that are characterized by a single error-effort optimum. To investigate motor optimization in the presence of multiple solutions and hence optima, we introduce a novel paradigm that enables us to let subjects repetitively (but inconspicuously) use different solutions and observe how exploration of multiple solutions affect their motor behavior. The results show that the behavior is largely influenced by motor memory with subjects tending to involuntarily repeat a recent suboptimal task-satisfying solution even after sufficient experience of the optimal solution. This suggests that the CNS does not optimize co-activation tasks globally but determines the motor behavior in a tradeoff of motor memory, error, and effort minimization.},

For decades, throwing skill acquisition has been the subject of developmental and gender studies. However, due to its complex multijoint nature, whole body throwing has found little space in quantitative studies of motor behavior. In this study we examined how overarm throwing varies within and between individuals in a sample of untrained adults. To quantitatively compare whole body kinematics across throwing actions, we introduced a new combination of spatiotemporal principal component, linear discrimination, and clustering analyses. We found that the identity and gender of a thrower can be robustly inferred by the kinematics of a single throw, reflecting the characteristic features in individual throwing strategies and providing a quantitative ground for the well-known differences between males and females in throwing behavior. We also identified four main classes of throwing strategies, stable within individuals and resembling the main stages of throwing proficiency acquisition during motor development. These results support earlier proposals linking interindividual and gender differences in throwing, with skill acquisition interrupted at different stages of the typical developmental trajectory of throwing motor behavior.NEW \& NOTEWORTHY Unconstrained throwing, because of its complexity, received little attention in quantitative motor control studies. By introducing a new approach to analyze whole body kinematics, we quantitatively characterized gender effects, interindividual differences, and common patterns in nontrained throwers. The four throwing styles identified across individuals resemble different stages in the acquisition of throwing skills during development. These results advance our understanding of complex motor skills, bridging the gap between motor control, motor development, and sport science.},

  abstract           = {A kinematic model of the arm was developed using high-resolution medical images obtained from the National Library of Medicine's Visible Human Project (VHP) dataset. The model includes seven joints and uses thirteen degrees of freedom to describe the relative movements of seven upper-extremity bones: the clavicle, scapula, humerus, ulna, radius, carpal bones, and hand. Two holonomic constraints were used to model the articulation between the scapula and the thorax. The kinematic structure of each joint was based on anatomical descriptions reported in the literature. The three joints comprising the shoulder girdle - the sternoclavicular joint, the acromioclavicular joint, and the glenohumeral joint - were each modeled as a three degree-of-freedom, ideal, ball-and-socket joint. The articulations at the elbow and wrist - humeroulnar flexion-extension, radioulnar pronation-supination, radiocarpal flexion-extension, and radiocarpal radial-ulnar deviation - were each modeled as a single degree-of-freedom, ideal, hinge joint. Locations of the joint centers and joint axes were derived by graphically inspecting the three-dimensional surfaces of the reconstructed bones. The relative positions of the bones were defined by fixing a reference frame to each bone; the position and orientation of each reference frame were based on the positions of anatomical landmarks and on the shapes of the reconstructed bone surfaces. Tables are provided which specify the positions and orientations of the joint axes and the bone-fixed reference frames for the model arm.},

This chapter introduces Nicholas Bernstein. The realization of controllability and observability in motor tasks is considered. Bernstein's emphasis upon motor tasks led him naturally to consider both the efferent initiation of motor activity and its resulting afferential or sensory consequences. In metaphors such as the “peripheral synapse,” he forcefully argued that afferent and efferent signals merely mediate communication between concurrent biomechanical and neurophysiological processes that unwind in time during the course of a motor act. This formulation of a neuro-biomechanical dynamics for a given motor task is implicit in the taxonomic mathematics. Bernstein is also typically associated with hierarchical theories of motor coordination. The externalized control variables and “tunings” of his task-dynamical functions, which could be supplied by higher levels of a motor hierarchy, lend themselves readily to that interpretation. Bernstein often postulates “a series of hierarchical levels, each of them, inevitably, having a degree of qualitative independence.”},

  abstract  = {Motor equivalence expresses the idea that movement components reorganize in the face of perturbations to preserve the value of important performance variables, such as the hand's position in reaching. A formal method is introduced to evaluate this concept quantitatively: changes in joint configuration due to unpredictable elbow perturbation lead to a smaller change in performance variables than expected given the magnitude of joint configuration change. This study investigated whether motor equivalence was present during the entire movement trajectory and how magnitude of motor equivalence was affected by constraints imposed by two different target types. Subjects pointed to spherical and cylindrical targets both with and without an elbow joint perturbation produced by a low- or high-stiffness elastic band. Subjects' view of their arm was blocked in the initial position, and the perturbation condition was randomized to avoid prediction of the perturbation or its magnitude. A modification of the uncontrolled manifold method variance analysis was used to investigate how changes in joint configuration on perturbed vs. nonperturbed trials (joint deviation vector) affected the hand's position or orientation. Evidence for motor equivalence induced by the perturbation was present from the reach onset and increased with the strength of the perturbation after 40\% of the reach, becoming more prominent as the reach progressed. Hand orientation was stabilized more strongly by motor equivalent changes in joint configuration than was three-dimensional position regardless of the target condition. Results are consistent with a recent model of neural control that allows for flexible patterns of joint coordination while resisting joint configuration deviations in directions that affect salient performance variables. The observations also fit a general scheme of synergic control with referent configurations defined across different levels of the motor hierarchy.},

Layers are made up of asynchronous modules that communicate over low-bandwidth channels. Each module is an instance of a fairly simple computational machine. Higher-level layers can subsume the roles of lower levels by suppressing their outputs. However, lower levels continue to function as higher levels are added. The result is a robust and flexible robot control system. The system has been used to control a mobile robot wandering around unconstrained laboratory areas and computer machine rooms. Eventually it is intended to control a robot that wanders the office areas of our laboratory, building maps of its surroundings using an onboard arm to perform simple tasks.},

Physiol. 49, 208-215; Graham-Brown (1922) The physiology of stepping, J. Neur. Psychopathol. 3, 112-116. Only in recent years, however, have the mechanisms been analyzed in detail. Quite a few of these mechanisms have been described using the decerebrate cat. Locomotion is initiated in decerebrate cats by activation of the mesencephalic locomotor region (MLR) that activates the medial medullary reticular formation (MRF) which in turn projects axons to the spinal cord which descend within the ventrolateral funiculus (VLF). The MRF region regulates as well as initiates the stepping pattern and is thought to be involved in interlimb coordination. Afferent feedback from proprioceptors and exteroceptors can modify the ongoing locomotor pattern. Recently, the types of afferents responsible for signaling the stance to swing transition have been identified. A general rule states that if the limb is unloaded and the leg is extended, then swing will occur. The afferents that detect unloading of the limb are the Golgi tendon organs and stimulation of these afferents (at group I strengths) prolongs the stance phase in walking cats. The afferents that detect the extension of the leg have been found to be the length- and velocity-sensitive muscle afferents located in flexor muscles. Plasticity of locomotor systems is discussed briefly in this article. Descerebrate animals can adapt locomotor behaviors to respond to new environmental conditions. Oligosynaptic reflex pathways that control locomotion can be recalibrated after injury in a manner that appears to be functionally related to the recovery of the animal.},

  abstract  = {Explanatory hypotheses proposed in behavioral studies assumed that less repetitive practice schedules, such as random practice, seem to demand greater cognitive effort than more repetitive types of practice organization, such as constant. All of these hypotheses emphasize the enhanced demand to memory processes promoted by less repetitive practice schedules. In the present study, we investigated the cognitive effort involved in random and constant practice schedules with an electrophysiological approach. Twenty-one male participants practiced a sequential key-pressing task with two goals: learning the relative timing dimension and learning the absolute timing dimension. Sixty trials were performed in a constant practice schedule (only one absolute timing goal), and sixty trials were performed in random order (three absolute timing goals). Two electroencephalography based measures of cognitive states were used: (a) task engagement (sensory processing and attention resources) and (b) mental workload (working memory load). The results showed that random practice induced greater cognitive effort than constant practice when task engagement was analyzed. Throughout practice, both task engagement and mental workload decreased more in the constant practice condition than in the random practice condition. The increased demand for sensory processing observed in random practice opens a new exciting field of study in practice organization.},

  abstract  = {Anticipating a potential benefit and how difficult it will be to obtain it are valuable skills in a constantly changing environment. In the human brain, the anticipation of reward is encoded by the Anterior Cingulate Cortex (ACC) and Striatum. Naturally, potential rewards have an incentive quality, resulting in a motivational effect improving performance. Recently it has been proposed that an upcoming task requiring effort induces a similar anticipation mechanism as reward, relying on the same cortico-limbic network. However, this overlapping anticipatory activity for reward and effort has only been investigated in a perceptual task. Whether this generalizes to high-level cognitive tasks remains to be investigated. To this end, an fMRI experiment was designed to investigate anticipation of reward and effort in cognitive tasks. A mental arithmetic task was implemented, manipulating effort (difficulty), reward, and delay in reward delivery to control for temporal confounds. The goal was to test for the motivational effect induced by the expectation of bigger reward and higher effort. The results showed that the activation elicited by an upcoming difficult task overlapped with higher reward prospect in the ACC and in the striatum, thus highlighting a pivotal role of this circuit in sustaining motivated behavior.},

  abstract  = {{Valid and reliable assessment of pain is essential for both clinical trials and effective pain management. The nature of pain makes objective measurement impossible. Acute pain can be reliably assessed, both at rest (important for comfort) and during movement (important for function and risk of postoperative complications), with one-dimensional tools such as numeric rating scales or visual analogue scales. Both these are more powerful in detecting changes in pain intensity than a verbal categorical rating scale. In acute pain trials, assessment of baseline pain must ensure sufficient pain intensity for the trial to detect meaningful treatment effects. Chronic pain assessment and its impact on physical, emotional, and social functions require multidimensional qualitative tools and health-related quality of life instruments. Several disease- and patient-specific functional scales are useful, such as the Western Ontario and MacMaster Universities for osteoarthritis, and several neuropathic pain screening tools. The Initiative on Methods, Measurement, and Pain Assessment in Clinical Trials recommendations for outcome measurements of chronic pain trials are also useful for routine assessment. Cancer pain assessment is complicated by a number of other bodily and mental symptoms such as fatigue and depression, all affecting quality of life. It is noteworthy that quality of life reported by chronic pain patients can be as much affected as that of terminal cancer patients. Any assessment of pain must take into account other factors, such as cognitive impairment or dementia, and assessment tools validated in the specific patient groups being studied.}},

This definition has become accepted widely by health care professionals and researchers in the pain field and adopted by several professional, governmental, and nongovernmental organizations, including the World Health Organization. In recent years, some in the field have reasoned that advances in our understanding of pain warrant a reevaluation of the definition and have proposed modifications. Therefore, in 2018, the IASP formed a 14-member, multinational Presidential Task Force comprising individuals with broad expertise in clinical and basic science related to pain, to evaluate the current definition and accompanying note and recommend whether they should be retained or changed. This review provides a synopsis of the critical concepts, the analysis of comments from the IASP membership and public, and the committee's final recommendations for revisions to the definition and notes, which were discussed over a 2-year period. The task force ultimately recommended that the definition of pain be revised to "An unpleasant sensory and emotional experience associated with, or resembling that associated with, actual or potential tissue damage," and that the accompanying notes be updated to a bulleted list that included the etymology. The revised definition and notes were unanimously accepted by the IASP Council early this year.},

  abstract           = {The knowledge of surface electromyography (SEMG) and the number of applications have increased considerably during the past ten years. However, most methodological developments have taken place locally, resulting in different methodologies among the different groups of users.A specific objective of the European concerted action SENIAM (surface EMG for a non-invasive assessment of muscles) was, besides creating more collaboration among the various European groups, to develop recommendations on sensors, sensor placement, signal processing and modeling. This paper will present the process and the results of the development of the recommendations for the SEMG sensors and sensor placement procedures. Execution of the SENIAM sensor tasks, in the period 1996-1999, has been handled in a number of partly parallel and partly sequential activities. A literature scan was carried out on the use of sensors and sensor placement procedures in European laboratories. In total, 144 peer-reviewed papers were scanned on the applied SEMG sensor properties and sensor placement procedures. This showed a large variability of methodology as well as a rather insufficient description. A special workshop provided an overview on the scientific and clinical knowledge of the effects of sensor properties and sensor placement procedures on the SEMG characteristics. Based on the inventory, the results of the topical workshop and generally accepted state-of-the-art knowledge, a first proposal for sensors and sensor placement procedures was defined. Besides containing a general procedure and recommendations for sensor placement, this was worked out in detail for 27 different muscles. This proposal was evaluated in several European laboratories with respect to technical and practical aspects and also sent to all members of the SENIAM club (>100 members) together with a questionnaire to obtain their comments. Based on this evaluation the final recommendations of SENIAM were made and published (SENIAM 8: European recommendations for surface electromyography, 1999), both as a booklet and as a CD-ROM. In this way a common body of knowledge has been created on SEMG sensors and sensor placement properties as well as practical guidelines for the proper use of SEMG.},

  abstract               = {Stimulation of cutaneous nerves innervating the hand evokes prominent reflexes in many arm muscles during arm cycling. We hypothesized that the mechanisms controlling reflex modulation during the rhythmic arm swing of walking would be similar to that documented during arm cycling. Thus, we expected cutaneous reflexes to be modulated by position in the walking cycle (phase dependence) and be different when walking compared to contraction while standing (task dependence). Subjects performed static postures similar to those occurring during walking and also walked on a treadmill while the superficial radial nerve was electrically stimulated pseudorandomly throughout the step cycle. EMG was recorded bilaterally from upper limb muscles and kinematic recordings were obtained from the elbow and shoulder joints. Step cycle information was obtained from force-sensing insoles. Analysis was conducted after averaging contingent upon the occurrence of stimulation in the step cycle. Phase-dependent modulation of cutaneous reflexes at early (approximately 50-80 ms) and middle (approximately 80-120 ms) latencies was observed. Coordinated bilateral reflexes were seen in posterior deltoid and triceps brachii muscles. Task dependency was seen in that reflex amplitude was only correlated with background EMG during static contraction (75% of comparisons for both early and middle latency reflexes). During walking, no significant relationship between reflex amplitude and background EMG level was found. The results show that cutaneous reflex modulation during rhythmic upper limb movement is similar to that seen during arm cycling and to that observed in leg muscles during locomotion. These results add to the evidence that, during cyclical movements of the arms and legs, similar neural mechanisms observed only during movement (e.g. central pattern generators) control reflex output.},

The results show that our subjects learned to control the hand retraction movement in order to avoid the potential pain. Subject-specific motor strategies were used to modify the joint movement coordination to avoid hitting the obstacle with the elbow at the cost of increasing the risk of hand slap. Furthermore, they used a conservative strategy as if assuming an obstacle in 100% of the trials.},

  abstract           = {Phase-dependent reflex modulation was studied by recording the electromyographic (EMG) responses in ankle flexors (Tibialis Anterior, TA) and extensors (Gastrocnemius Medialis, GM and Soleus, SOL) to a 20 ms train of electrical pulses, applied to the tibial or sural nerve at the ankle, in human volunteers walking on a treadmill at 4 km/h. For low intensity stimuli (i.e. 1.6 times perception threshold), given during the swing phase, the most common response was a suppression of the TA activity with a latency of 67 to 118 ms. With high intensity of stimulation (i.e. 2.8 x T), a facilitatory response appeared in TA with a latency of 74 ms. This latter response was largest during the middle of the swing phase, when it was correlated with exaggerated ankle dorsiflexion. The TA reflex amplitude was not a simple function of the level of spontaneous ongoing activity. During stance, TA responses were small or absent and accompanied by a suppression of the GM activity with a latency ranging from 62 to 101 ms. A few subjects showed an early facilitatory, instead of a suppressive, GM response (88 to 136 ms latency). They showed a phase-dependent reflex reversal from a dominant TA response during swing to a facilitatory GM response with an equivalent latency during stance. The GM facilitation occurred exclusively during the early stance phase and habituated more than the TA responses. It is concluded that phase-dependent gating of reflexes occurs in ankle muscles of man, but only when vigorous extensor reflexes are present. More commonly, a phase-dependent modulation is seen, both of facilitatory and suppressive responses.},

  abstract               = {The flexion or flexor reflex (FR) recorded in the lower limbs in humans (LLFR) is a widely investigated neurophysiological tool. It is a polysynaptic and multisegmental spinal response that produces a withdrawal of the stimulated limb and resembles (having several features in common) the hind-paw FR in animals. The FR, in both animals and humans, is mediated by a complex circuitry modulated at spinal and supraspinal level. At rest, the LLFR (usually obtained by stimulating the sural/tibial nerve and by recording from the biceps femoris/tibial anterior muscle) appears as a double burst composed of an early, inconstantly present component, called the RII reflex, and a late, larger and stable component, called the RIII reflex. Numerous studies have shown that the afferents mediating the RII reflex are conveyed by large-diameter, low-threshold, non-nociceptive A-beta fibers, and those mediating the RIII reflex by small-diameter, high-threshold nociceptive A-delta fibers. However, several afferents, including nociceptive and non-nociceptive fibers from skin and muscles, have been found to contribute to LLFR activation. Since the threshold of the RIII reflex has been shown to correspond to the pain threshold and the size of the reflex to be related to the level of pain perception, it has been suggested that the RIII reflex might constitute a useful tool to investigate pain processing at spinal and supraspinal level, pharmacological modulation and pathological pain conditions. As stated in EFNS guidelines, the RIII reflex is the most widely used of all the nociceptive reflexes, and appears to be the most reliable in the assessment of treatment efficacy. However, the RIII reflex use in the clinical evaluation of neuropathic pain is still limited. In addition to its nocifensive function, the LLFR seems to be linked to posture and locomotion. This may be explained by the fact that its neuronal circuitry, made up of a complex pool of interneurons, is interposed in motor control and, during movements, receives both peripheral afferents (flexion reflex afferents, FRAs) and descending commands, forming a multisensorial feedback mechanism and projecting the output to motoneurons. LLFR excitability, mediated by this complex circuitry, is finely modulated in a state- and phase-dependent manner, rather as we observe in the FR in animal models. Several studies have demonstrated that LLFR excitability may be influenced by numerous physiological conditions (menstrual cycle, stress, attention, sleep and so on) and pathological states (spinal lesions, spasticity, Wallenberg's syndrome, fibromyalgia, headaches and so on). Finally, the LLFR is modulated by several drugs and neurotransmitters. In summary, study of the LLFR in humans has proved to be an interesting functional window onto the spinal and supraspinal mechanisms of pain processing and onto the spinal neural control mechanisms operating during posture and locomotion.},

  abstract           = {The organization and pattern of cutaneous reflex modulation is unknown during rhythmic cyclical movements of the human upper limbs. On the assumption that these cyclic arm movements are central pattern generator (CPG) driven as has been suggested for leg movements such as walking, we hypothesized that cutaneous reflex amplitude would be independent of electromyographic (EMG) muscle activation level during rhythmic arm movement (phase-dependent modulation, as is often the case in the lower limb during locomotion). EMG was recorded from eight muscles crossing the human shoulder, elbow, and wrist joints while whole arm rhythmic cyclical movements were performed. Cutaneous reflexes were evoked with trains of electrical stimulation delivered at non-noxious intensities (approximately 2 x threshold for radiating paresthesia) to the superficial radial nerve innervating the lateral portion of the back of the hand. Phasic bursts of rhythmic muscle activity occurred throughout the movement cycle. Rhythmic EMG and kinematic patterns were similar to what has been seen in the human lower limb during locomotor activities such as cycling or walking: there were extensive periods of reciprocal activation of antagonist muscles. For most muscles, cutaneous reflexes were modulated with the movement cycle and were strongly correlated with the movement-related background EMG amplitude. It is concluded that cutaneous reflexes are primarily modulated by the background muscle activity during rhythmic human upper limb movements, with only some muscles showing phase-dependent modulation.},

Furthermore, the design and control of mechatronic devices can also benefit from such neuroscientific outcomes, with important implications for assistive and rehabilitation robotics and advanced human-machine interaction. To reach these goals, we believe that an exhaustive data collection on human behavior is a mandatory step. For this reason, we release U-Limb, a large, multi-modal, multi-center data collection on human upper limb movements, with the aim of fostering trans-disciplinary cross-fertilization.This collection of signals consists of data from 91 able-bodied and 65 post-stroke participants and is organized at 3 levels: (i) upper limb daily living activities, during which kinematic and physiological signals (electromyography, electro-encephalography, and electrocardiography) were recorded; (ii) force-kinematic behavior during precise manipulation tasks with a haptic device; and (iii) brain activity during hand control using functional magnetic resonance imaging.}",

This article presents an improved modification of the original dynamic movement primitive (DMP) framework by Ijspeert et al [1], [2]. The new equations can generalize movements to new targets without singularities and large accelerations. Furthermore, the new equations can represent a movement in 3D task space without depending on the choice of coordinate system (invariance under invertible affine transformations). Our modified DMP is motivated from biological data (spinal-cord stimulation in frogs) and human behavioral experiments. We further extend the formalism to obstacle avoidance by exploiting the robustness against perturbations: an additional term is added to the differential equations to make the robot steer around an obstacle. This additional term empirically describes human obstacle avoidance. We demonstrate the feasibility of our approach using the Sarcos Slave robot arm: after learning a single placing movement, the robot placed a cup between two arbitrarily given positions and avoided approaching obstacles.},

  abstract  = {Dynamic movement primitives (DMPs) were proposed as an efficient way for learning and control of complex robot behaviors. They can be used to represent point-to-point and periodic movements and can be applied in Cartesian or in joint space. One problem that arises when DMPs are used to define control policies in Cartesian space is that there exists no minimal, singularity-free representation of orientation. In this paper we show how dynamic movement primitives can be defined for non minimal, singularity free representations of orientation, such as rotation matrices and quaternions. All of the advantages of DMPs, including ease of learning, the ability to include coupling terms, and scale and temporal invariance, can be adopted in our formulation. We have also proposed a new phase stopping mechanism to ensure full movement reproduction in case of perturbations.},

    abstract = { In this paper we introduce the Pisa/IIT SoftHand, a novel robot hand prototype designed with the purpose of being robust and easy to control as an industrial gripper, while exhibiting high grasping versatility and an aspect similar to that of the human hand. In the paper we briefly review the main theoretical tools used to enable such simplification, i.e. the neuroscience-based notion of soft synergies. A discussion of several possible actuation schemes shows that a straightforward implementation of the soft synergy idea in an effective design is not trivial. The approach proposed in this paper, called adaptive synergy, rests on ideas coming from underactuated hand design. A synthesis method to realize a desired set of soft synergies through the principled design of adaptive synergy is discussed. This approach leads to the design of hands accommodating in principle an arbitrary number of soft synergies, as demonstrated in grasping and manipulation simulations and experiments with a prototype. As a particular instance of application of the synthesis method of adaptive synergies, the Pisa/IIT SoftHand is described in detail. The hand has 19 joints, but only uses 1 actuator to activate its adaptive synergy. Of particular relevance in its design is the very soft and safe, yet powerful and extremely robust structure, obtained through the use of innovative articulations and ligaments replacing conventional joint design. The design and implementation of the prototype hand are shown and its effectiveness demonstrated through grasping experiments, reported also in multimedia extension. }

    abstract = { This paper summarizes recent activities carried out for the development of an innovative anthropomorphic robotic hand called the DEXMART Hand. The main goal of this research is to face the problems that affect current robotic hands by introducing suitable design solutions aimed at achieving simplification and cost reduction while possibly enhancing robustness and performance. While certain aspects of the DEXMART Hand development have been presented in previous papers, this paper is the first to give a comprehensive description of the final hand version and its use to replicate human-like grasping. In this paper, particular emphasis is placed on the kinematics of the fingers and of the thumb, the wrist architecture, the dimensioning of the actuation system, and the final implementation of the position, force and tactile sensors. The paper focuses also on how these solutions have been integrated into the mechanical structure of this innovative robotic hand to enable precise force and displacement control of the whole system.Another important aspect is the lack of suitable control tools that severely limits the development of robotic hand applications. To address this issue, a new method for the observation of human hand behavior during interaction with common day-to-day objects by means of a 3D computer vision system is presented in this work together with a strategy for mapping human hand postures to the robotic hand. A simple control strategy based on postural synergies has been used to reduce the complexity of the grasp planning problem. As a preliminary evaluation of the DEXMART Hand’s capabilities, this approach has been adopted in this paper to simplify and speed up the transfer of human actions to the robotic hand, showing its effectiveness in reproducing human-like grasping. }

	abstract = {How the CNS selects the appropriate muscle patterns to achieve a behavioral goal is an open question. To gain insight into this process, we characterized the spatiotemporal organization of the muscle patterns for fast-reaching movements. We recorded electromyographic activity from up to 19 shoulder and arm muscles during point-to-point movements between a central location and 8 peripheral targets in each of 2 vertical planes. We used an optimization algorithm to identify a set of time-varying muscle synergies, i.e., the coordinated activations of groups of muscles with specific time-varying profiles. For each one of nine subjects, we extracted four or five synergies whose combinations, after scaling in amplitude and shifting in time each synergy independently for each movement condition, explained 73{\textendash}82\% of the data variation. We then tested whether these synergies could reconstruct the muscle patterns for point-to-point movements with different loads or forearm postures and for reversal and via-point movements. We found that reconstruction accuracy remained high, indicating generalization across these conditions. Finally, the synergy amplitude coefficients were directionally tuned according to a cosine function with a preferred direction that showed a smaller variability with changes of load, posture, and endpoint than the preferred direction of individual muscles. Thus the complex spatiotemporal characteristics of the muscles patterns for reaching were captured by the combinations of a small number of components, suggesting that the mechanisms involved in the generation of the muscle patterns exploit this low dimensionality to simplify control.},

The chosen objects typically are held with a variety of grips, including {\textquotedblleft}precision{\textquotedblright} and {\textquotedblleft}power{\textquotedblright} grips. Static hand posture was measured by recording the angular position of 15 joint angles of the fingers and of the thumb. Although subjects adopted distinct hand shapes for the various objects, the joint angles of the digits did not vary independently. Principal components analysis showed that the first two components could account for \&gt;80\% of the variance, implying a substantial reduction from the 15 degrees of freedom that were recorded. However, even though they were small, higher-order (more than three) principal components did not represent random variability but instead provided additional information about the object. These results suggest that the control of hand posture involves a few postural synergies, regulating the general shape of the hand, coupled with a finer control mechanism providing for small, subtle adjustments. Because the postural synergies did not coincide with grip taxonomies, the results suggest that hand posture may be regulated independently from the control of the contact forces that are used to grasp an object.},

  abstract  = {Roughly one quarter of active upper limb prosthetic technology is rejected by the user, and user surveys have identified key areas requiring improvement: function, comfort, cost, durability, and appearance. Here we present the first systematic, clinical assessment of a novel prosthetic hand, the SoftHand Pro (SHP), in participants with transradial amputation and age-matched, limb-intact participants. The SHP is a robust and functional prosthetic hand that minimizes cost and weight using an underactuated design with a single motor. Participants with limb loss were evaluated on functional clinical measures before and after a 6‚Äì8 hour training period with the SHP as well as with their own prosthesis; limb-intact participants were tested only before and after SHP training. Participants with limb loss also evaluated their own prosthesis and the SHP (following training) using subjective questionnaires. Both objective and subjective results were positive and illuminated the strengths and weaknesses of the SHP. In particular, results pre-training show the SHP is easy to use, and significant improvement in the Activities Measure for Upper Limb Amputees in both groups following a 6‚Äì8 hour training highlights the ease of learning the unique features of the SHP (median improvement: 4.71 and 3.26 and p = 0.009 and 0.036 for limb loss and limb-intact groups, respectively). Further, we found no difference in performance compared to participant‚Äôs own commercial devices in several clinical measures and found performance surpassing these devices on two functional tasks, buttoning a shirt and using a cell phone, suggesting a functional prosthetic design. Finally, improvements are needed in the SHP design and/or training in light of poor results in small object manipulation. Taken together, these results show the promise of the SHP, a flexible and adaptive prosthetic hand, and pave a path forward to ensuring higher functionality in future.},

ABSTRACT={Due to the limitations of myoelectric control (such as dependence on muscular fatigue and on electrodes shift, difficulty in decoding complex patterns or in dealing with simultaneous movements), there is a renewal of interest in the movement-based control approaches for prosthetics. The latter use residual limb movements rather than muscular activity as command inputs, in order to develop more natural and intuitive control techniques. Among those, several research works rely on the interjoint coordinations that naturally exist in human upper limb movements. These relationships are modeled to control the distal joints (e.g., elbow) based on the motions of proximal ones (e.g., shoulder). The regression techniques, used to model the coordinations, are various [Artificial Neural Networks, Principal Components Analysis (PCA), etc.] and yet, analysis of their performance and impact on the prosthesis control is missing in the literature. Is there one technique really more efficient than the others to model interjoint coordinations? To answer this question, we conducted an experimental campaign to compare the performance of three common regression techniques in the control of the elbow joint on a transhumeral prosthesis. Ten non-disabled subjects performed a reaching task, while wearing an elbow prosthesis which was driven by several interjoint coordination models obtained through different regression techniques. The models of the shoulder-elbow kinematic relationship were built from the recordings of fifteen different non-disabled subjects that performed a similar reaching task with their healthy arm. Among Radial Basis Function Networks (RBFN), Locally Weighted Regression (LWR), and PCA, RBFN was found to be the most robust, based on the analysis of several criteria including the quality of generated movements but also the compensatory strategies exhibited by users. Yet, RBFN does not significantly outperform LWR and PCA. The regression technique seems not to be the most significant factor for improvement of interjoint coordinations-based control. By characterizing the impact of the modeling techniques through closed-loop experiments with human users instead of purely offline simulations, this work could also help in improving movement-based control approaches and in bringing them closer to a real use by patients.}
