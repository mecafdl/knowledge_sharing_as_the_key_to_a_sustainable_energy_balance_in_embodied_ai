In this work, we show that existing software-based energy estimations are not accurate because they do not take into account hardware differences and how resource utilization affects energy consumption. We conduct energy measurement experiments with four different models for a question answering task. We quantify the error of existing software-based energy estimations by using a hardware power meter that provides highly accurate energy measurements. Our key takeaway is the need for a more accurate energy estimation model that takes into account hardware variabilities and the non-linear relationship between resource utilization and energy consumption. We release the code and data at https://github.com/csarron/sustainlp2020-energy.},

  abstract  = {This chapter discusses networked robots, multiple robots operating together coordinating and cooperating by networked communication to accomplish a specified task. This chapter presents an overview of the field with an emphasis on recent results and research challenges. Multiple robots enable new capabilities and the communication network enables new approaches and solutions that are difficult with just perception and control. Communication enables new control and perception capabilities in the system (e.g., access to information outside the perception range of the robot system). Conversely, control enables solutions for problems that are difficult without mobility (e.g., localization). Section 41.1 defines the field, examines the benefits of networking in robot coordination, and discusses applications. Section 41.2 highlights a few projects focused on networked robotics and discusses the application potential of the field. Section 41.3 discusses the research challenges at the intersection of control, communication, and perception. Section 41.4 defines a model for the control of a networked system which is used in Sects. 41.5--41.8 to examine specific research issues and opportunities facilitated by the interplay between communication, control, and perception.},
